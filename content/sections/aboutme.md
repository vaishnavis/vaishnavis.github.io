I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Precision Development (PxD)](https://www.precisiondev.org). My research focuses on rural markets for labor, credit, and information; the role of gender in these markets; and farmer adaptation to climate change through these markets.

I received a PhD from the Department of [Agricultural and Resource Economics](https://are.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley in August, 2020, and was a postdoctoral scholar in the department between 2020 and 2021.
